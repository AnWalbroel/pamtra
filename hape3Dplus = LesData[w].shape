Function to create Pamtra Profiles.

Variables ending on _lev mean level values, variables without are layer values (height vector one entry shorter!)!

Everything is needed in SI units, relhum is in Pa/PA not %

The following variables are mandatroy:
hgt_lev, temp_lev, press_lev and (relhum_lev OR q)

The following variables are optional and guessed if not provided:  "timestamp","lat","lon","lfrac","wind10u","wind10v","hgt_lev","cwc_q","iwc_q","rwc_q","swc_q","gwc_q"

The integrated values are skipped if not provided, they have no effect on pamtra!:
"iwv","cwp","iwp","rwp","swp","gwp"

The following variables are only needed together with the 2 moments scheme!
"hwc_q","hwp", "cwc_n","iwc_n","rwc_n","swc_n","gwc_n","hwc_n"
